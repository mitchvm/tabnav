This file contains multiple Org Mode tables with only a single line of whitespace between the first two. The first table is the basic Org Mode table syntax, with a header separator row.

The table above has column "grouping" markers, and isn't fully left-justified - there is leading whitespace. The table below has display width restrictions.

| Narrow cell | Another very very wide cell    |
|             | <15>                           |
| Narrower    | And yet another very wide cell |

This is a table "escaped" in a simple literal - a line starting with a colon and a space. (It appears that the OrgExtended package doesn't capture this as raw syntax.)

And this is a table in a proper source code block, which is captured as a "orgmode.raw.block" scope.
