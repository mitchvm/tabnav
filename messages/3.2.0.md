## TabNav v3.2.0:

This version introduces several new commands:

* Jump selection to end of row/column
    - The recommended key bindings for this are Ctrl+Alt+[direction] on Windows/Linux, or Command+Control+[direction] on Mac, where [direction] is one of the standard direction keys used for the other movement commands.
