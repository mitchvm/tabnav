## TabNav v3.2.0:

This version introduces two new commands:

* Select last cell:
    - Moves all selections to the furthest cell in the row/column in the desired direction.
* Extend selection to end:
    -  Selects all cells in the row/column between the currently selected cell and the end of the row/column in the desired direction.

The recommended key bindings for the commands are:

| Command                    | Windows/Linux              | macOS             |
|:---------------------------|:---------------------------|:------------------|
| Select last cell...        | Ctrl+Alt+[direction]       | ⌘+^+[direction]   |
| Extend selection to end... | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+[direction] | ⌘+^+⇧+[direction] |

Note that the recommended key binding for disabling TabNav on the current view has been removed to free up the key binding for Extend selection to end of row. The Disable TabNav command can, of course, be mapped to a different key binding, or be invoked from the Command Palette or menu.
